# Mario dos Reis, PI

![](/assets/figs/mario.png)

Mario’s research in evolutionary biology focuses on obtaining inferences from genomic data to understand species adaptation and evolution through time.  His research involves both, the development of statistical tools to analyse molecular sequences, and the application of those tools in empirical data analysis.  He is particularly interested in working out the timeline of mammal evolution and other animals, as case studies in evolutionary biology. Mario is a lecturer in genomics at Queen Mary University of London.

# Gustavo Ballen, Postdoc

Gustavo finished his PhD in São Paulo, Brazil, and has joined the lab to work on the development and application of morphological models in Bayesian models of divergence time estimation. You can checkout Gustavo's research in [his homepage](https://gaballench.wordpress.com).  

# Muthukumaran Panchaksaram, PhD student

Muthukumaran graduated as B.Tech (Bachelor of technology) in biotechnology at Sathyabama University, Chennai, India. He then pursued further studies in the same branch as a M.Tech student at Vellore Institute of Technology. His research focussed on designing a statistical QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) model using multivariate image analysis for the prediction of biological activities of flavonoid derivatives, pharmaceutically active against acetylcholinesterase and HIV-1 inhibitors. As a PhD student in the lab, he is working on statistical methods to detect adaptation in molecular sequences.

# Joseph Minus, PhD student

Joseph is working on mammalian morphometrics and clock dating in close collaboration with Anjali Goswami (NHM).

# Nayelí Escudero Castelán, PhD student

Nayelí is working with Prof. Maurice Elphick and Dr. dos Reis on the evolution of neuropeptides in echinoderms.

# Past Members

# Sandra Álvarez-Carretero (2016-2020), PhD student

![](/assets/figs/sandra.png)

Sandra obtained a BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Universidad Rovira I Virgili, in Spain, and then an MSc in Bioinformatics at Högskolan I Skövde, in Sweden. Sandra was a PhD student in the lab between 2016 and 2020 working on the application of Bayesian MCMC statistical methods to study species divergences through time. She finished her PhD with eight papers and she won the 2019 Ernst Mayr Award from the Society of Systematic Biologists.

# Lucas Freitas (2019), Postdoc

Lucas visited the lab between January 2019 and January 2020, to work on methods of clock dating, and to detect positive selection and convergent evolution in molecular sequences.

# Gabriela Calegario (2019), Postdoc

Gabriela visited the lab between January 2019 and January 2020, to work on phylogenetic identification of prokaryotes from core samples of the ocean floor under the Amazon River discharge plume.

# Iván Ezquerra Romano (2018), PhD student

Iván did his PhD rotation (BBSRC LIDo) in the lab, using the multi-species coalescent to date divergences among human populations.

# Joseph Deane (2021), MSc student

Joseph worked on assessing the effect of rate correlation among loci (i.e. the lineage effect) on Bayesian estimation of divergence times.

# Hasmita Patel (2018), MSc student

Hasmita did her MSc Bioinformatics project at the dos Reis lab on analysis of human populations under the Bayesian multi-species coalescent model.
