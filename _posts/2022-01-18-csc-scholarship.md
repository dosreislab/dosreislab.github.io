A Chinese Scholarship Council PhD Scholarship to work on development of Bayesian
MCMC methods of the molecular clock is available in our lab. The molecular clock
is the approximately constant rate of accumulation of single nucleotide changes
in the genomes of organisms. By aligning the genomes of species and inferring
the number of changes in the branches of their evolutionary tree, we can infer
the geological times of the species divergences. The state-of-the-art in the
field is to use Bayesian statistics, which requires computationally expensive
stochastic simulation (MCMC) of evolutionary timelines. Building evolutionary
timelines is one of the fundamental goals of biology as it allows inferring
correlations between the origin of species and the geological past of the
planet.

The project is suitable for students with interests in software development and
statistical analysis of big data.

If you are interesting in learning more about the work in our lab, you can read
our recent paper in Nature in which we inferred the evolutionary timeline of
mammals:

integrating phylogenomic data**.

We have also written a major review on the molecular clock:

divergences in the genomics era**.
