We currently have two PhD project opportunities, for starting in **October 2025**. Both projects are to work on the development and application of Bayesian phylogenetic methods.

The first is a NERC sponsored project, and is part of the new London Doctoral Landscape awards in environmental science (broadly defined to also include biodiversity, conservation and evoluton). Deadline for applications is **20th January 2025**. Full details and instructions [here](https://www.trees-dla.ac.uk/projects/integrating-morphology-and-genomes-infer-evolutionary-timescales).

The second is a CSC (China Scholarship Council) sponsored project. This project has two application deadlines, one on the **29th January 2025** for application to QMUL. If successufl, applicants can then submit a full application to the CSC.
