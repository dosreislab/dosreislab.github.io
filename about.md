This is the website of **dos Reis Lab** research group @ [QMUL](http://www.qmul.ac.uk)

Research in the dos Reis lab is focused on the development and application of statistical methods in phylogenetics. We are particularly interested in using Bayesian statistics to infer times of species divergences (that is, in placing geological times of divergence on the Tree of Life), and on methods to measure the strength of natural selection in molecular sequences. You can see examples of our research in the Key Publications below.

**Interested in doing a PhD?** We currently have project submitted for the BBSRC LiDO and NERC DTP PhD programmes starting in 2017.

**Interested in doing a postdoc?** We're happy to discuss funding options, such as the Royal Society Newton Fellowship (opening Jan 2018), Marie Curie, Leverhulme grants, etc.
